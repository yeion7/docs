[Preact](https://preactjs.com/) is a fast 3kB alternative to React with the same modern API.

In this guide, we will cover how to set up a Preact application with [Preact CLI](https://github.com/preactjs/preact-cli) and how to deploy it with [ZEIT Now](/docs/v2).

## Step 1: Set Up Your Preact Project

If you do not have the Preact CLI installed currently, use the following command to install it globally:

<Snippet dark text="yarn global add preact-cli" />

Get started by setting up a Preact application with Preact CLI and the following command:

<Snippet dark text="preact create default my-preact-app && cd my-preact-app" />

## Step 2: Deploying to ZEIT Now

With your project set up, you are ready to deploy your Preact application with [ZEIT Now](/now).

If you have not yet installed Now, you can do so by [installing Now CLI](/download).

You can now deploy your Preact application with **just a single command**:

<Snippet dark text="now" />

If you want to deploy your Preact project from a Git repository, you can use either [Now for GitHub](/docs/v2/advanced/now-for-github/) or [Now for GitLab](/docs/v2/advanced/now-for-gitlab/) to have your project automatically deployed on every push, and aliased on push to master.
