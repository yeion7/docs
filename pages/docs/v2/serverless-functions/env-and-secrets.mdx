When using Serverless Functions, it may be necessary to pass environment variables, allowing you to specify potentially different behavior based on the environment it is running in.

Adding environment variables requires two steps, defining the environment variable, then making it available to your Serverless Functions.

## Adding Secrets

To define an environment variable for a deployment, use **Now Secrets**. By using **Now Secrets**, the data will be encrypted and stored securely.

Adding **Now Secrets** can be done with [Now CLI](/download), which provides three options to work with them.

To **define a Now Secret**, use the following command:

<Snippet dark text="now secrets add <secret-name> <secret-value>" />

To **remove a Now Secret**, use the following command:

<Snippet dark text="now secrets rm <secret-name>" />

To **rename a Now Secret**, use the following command:

<Snippet dark text="now secrets rename <secret-name> <new-name>" />

## Providing Environment Variables

To provide your Serverless Functions with the environment variables you have defined, whether declared in a `.env` file or as a [Now Secret](#adding-secrets), create a `now.json` file like the one below:

```json
{
  "env": {
    "VARIABLE_NAME": "@variable-name"
  }
}
```

To use the environment variable from inside the application you would need to reference it using the correct syntax for the language being used. For example, using Node.js, the syntax would be:

```
process.env.VARIABLE_NAME
```

Now, whenever the `process.env.VARIABLE_NAME` key is used, it will provide the application with the value declared either by the [Now Secret](#adding-secrets) or [environment variable](#during-local-development), dependent on the environment the application is running in.

<Note hint>
  To use environment variables at the <b>build step of your application</b>,

  .
</Note>

## During Local Development

When using `now dev` to [develop your Serverless Functions locally](/docs/v2/serverless-functions/introduction/#local-development), [Now Secrets](#adding-secrets) are not available. This is a security measure, to prevent accidental use of production secrets during development.

To use environment variables during local development, create a `.env` file at the root of your project directory, for example:

```
VARIABLE_NAME=variable_value
```
