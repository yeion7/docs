If there's information or certain behavior of your project that needs to differ depending on if it's running locally or on Now, environment variables offer the perfect solution.

This document explores how you should look to define environment variables, before making them available in your project.

## Defining Environment Variables

We recommend defining environment variables for each environment you wish to run your application in, using **Now Secrets** for cloud deployment and a `.env` file for local development.

### Cloud Deployment

To make sensitive information available to your project once deployed, we recommend using **Now Secrets**. By using **Now Secrets**, the data will be encrypted and stored securely, no longer directly accessible by anyone, and only exposed to deployments as environment variables.

To **define a Now Secret**, use the following command:

<Snippet dark text="now secrets add <secret-name> <secret-value>" />

To **remove a Now Secret**, use the following command:

<Snippet dark text="now secrets rm <secret-name>" />
<Caption>Removing a <b>Now Secret</b> using <GenericLink href="/now">Now CLI</GenericLink>.</Caption>

To **rename a Now Secret**, use the following command:

<Snippet dark text="now secrets rename <secret-name> <new-name>" />
<Caption>Renaming a <b>Now Secret</b> using <GenericLink href="/now">Now CLI</GenericLink>.</Caption>

### Local Development

When developing locally, we recommend using a `.env` file to define your environment variables. This provides a clear separation from your production secrets and provides you with a great deal of flexibility when changing environment variables during development.

You can also use a `.env.build` file to make environment variables available to the build process of your application if required.

The syntax of a `.env` file is simple as illustrated by the example below:

```
ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE_NAME=environment-variable-value
```

## Accessing Environment Variables

Regardless of whether you are using **Now Secrets** for a deployment or a `.env` file for local development, there is a single, unified method to make environment variables accessible to your application.

To make your defined environment variables available to your application, create a `now.json` file with an `env` property like the example below:

```json
{
  "env": {
    "VARIABLE_NAME": "@environment-variable-name"
  }
}
```

  with a defined environment variable.

The above example will make the key `VARIABLE_NAME` available to an application which will give access to the variable defined either as a **Now Secret** or inside a `.env` file.

To use the environment variable from inside the application you would need to reference it using the correct syntax for the language being used. For example, using Node.js, the syntax would be:

```
process.env.VARIABLE_NAME
```

The syntax required to make the environment variable available inside the build process of your application is very similar and is shown below:

```json
{
  "build": {
    "env": {
      "VARIABLE_NAME": "@environment-variable-name"
    }
  }
}
```

### Built-In Variables

By default, all deployments expose the `NOW_REGION` environment variable to [lambdas](/docs/v2/advanced/concepts/lambdas) which provides the [region](/docs/v2/advanced/platform/regions-and-providers/) that the lambda was deployed to.

### Reserved Variables

The following environment variables are [reserved](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/current-supported-versions.html#lambda-environment-variables) and therefore unavailable for use:

- **`AWS_REGION`**
- **`AWS_DEFAULT_REGION`**
- **`AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`**
- **`AWS_SECRET_KEY`**
- **`AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`**
- **`AWS_EXECUTION_ENV`**
- **`AWS_LAMBDA_LOG_GROUP_NAME`**
- **`AWS_LAMBDA_LOG_STREAM_NAME`**
- **`AWS_LAMBDA_FUNCTION_NAME`**
- **`AWS_LAMBDA_FUNCTION_MEMORY_SIZE`**
- **`AWS_LAMBDA_FUNCTION_VERSION`**
- **`AWS_SESSION_TOKEN`**
- **`NOW_REGION`**
- **`TZ`**
- **`_HANDLER`**
- **`LAMBDA_TASK_ROOT`**
- **`LAMBDA_RUNTIME_DIR`**

Using either, or any, of these as a name for your environment variables, will result in the deployment failing.
