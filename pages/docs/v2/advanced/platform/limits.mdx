This page outlines all relevant limits on the ZEIT Now platform.

The table consists of the following four columns:

- **Description** - A brief description of the limit which, where relevant, will advise what type of plan it applies to.
- **Limit** - The amount of actions permitted within the amount of time (**Duration**) specified.
- **Duration** - The amount of time (seconds) in which you can perform the specified amount of actions in. Once a rate limit is hit, it will be reset after the **Duration** has expired.
- **Scope** - Who the limit applies to, `owner` refers to the account owner, `user` refers to an individual user on a **Team** account.

## Examples

Below are three examples that provide further information on how the rate limits work.

### Domain Deletion

Taking the domains deletion rate limit as an example, you are allowed to delete up to `60` domains every `60` seconds (1 minute). Should you hit the rate limit, you will need to wait another minute before deleting another domain.

### Team Deletion

With the team deletion rate limit, you are able to delete up to `20` teams every `3600` seconds (1 hour). Should you hit the rate limit, you will need to wait another hour before deleting another team.

### Username Update

For the username update rate limit, you are able to change your username up to `6` times every `604800` seconds (1 week). Should you hit the rate limit, you will need to wait another week before changing your username again.
